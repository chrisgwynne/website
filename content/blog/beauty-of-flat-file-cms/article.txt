In an age of complex database-driven applications, there's something refreshingly simple about flat-file content management. No MySQL, no PostgreSQL, no connection strings to configure. Just text files in folders.

## What is a Flat-File CMS?

Unlike WordPress or Drupal which store content in databases, flat-file systems like Kirby, Grav, and Statamic use the filesystem itself as the database. Content is stored in Markdown or YAML files, organized in directories.

Your content structure:

```
content/
├── blog/
│   ├── post-1/
│   │   └── article.txt
│   ├── post-2/
│   │   └── article.txt
```

## Advantages

**Version Control**: Content lives in Git. Track changes, revert mistakes, branch experiments.

**Portability**: Move your site by copying files. No database dumps or imports.

**Simplicity**: Fewer moving parts means fewer things to break.

**Performance**: No database queries means faster page loads.

**Security**: No SQL injection vectors when there's no SQL.

## Use Cases

Flat-file systems excel for:

- Personal blogs
- Documentation sites
- Portfolio websites
- Small business sites
- Landing pages

They're not ideal for massive e-commerce sites or applications requiring complex user relationships, but for content-driven sites, they're perfect.

## The Future

As static site generators like Hugo and Jekyll gain popularity, flat-file CMS systems offer a middle ground - dynamic capabilities with static simplicity.

The best part? You own your content. It's right there, in plain text, forever readable.
