I've been exploring static site generators and flat-file CMS options for a while. The goal was simple: create a fast, distraction-free blog that focuses purely on content. No bloat, no tracking, no unnecessary JavaScript.

After evaluating options like Jekyll, Hugo, and Ghost, I settled on (link: https://getkirby.com text: Kirby CMS). It's a flat-file CMS that offers the simplicity of static sites with the flexibility of dynamic content management.

## Why Kirby?

Kirby offers several advantages:

- **No database required**: Content is stored in text files
- **Flexible templating**: Uses PHP with a clean, readable syntax
- **Great admin panel**: When you need it, the panel is intuitive
- **Developer-friendly**: Easy to customize and extend

## The N-O-D-E Aesthetic

The design inspiration comes from (link: https://n-o-d-e.net text: N-O-D-E) - a technology blog that embraces brutalist/minimalist design principles:

- Monochrome color scheme (#222 background, #c8c8c8 text)
- Monospace typography (Share Tech Mono)
- Simple category tags like [HW], [SW], [BL]
- No images unless necessary
- Fast loading times

This approach puts content first and removes all visual distractions.

## Implementation Details

The blog uses Tailwind CSS for styling, compiled to a single CSS file. Templates are clean PHP with Kirby's excellent API:

```php
<?php foreach ($page->children()->sortBy('date', 'desc') as $article): ?>
  <li>
    <a href="<?= $article->url() ?>">
      <span class="tag">[BL]</span>
      <?= $article->title()->html() ?>
    </a>
  </li>
<?php endforeach ?>
```

Simple, readable, and maintainable.

## Next Steps

I'll be adding more features over time:

- Full-text search
- Archive by category
- Related posts
- RSS feed improvements

Stay tuned for more updates.
