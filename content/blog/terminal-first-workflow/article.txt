My computing environment has evolved significantly over the years. I've moved from heavy IDEs and GUI applications to a terminal-first approach that maximizes efficiency and minimizes distractions.

## The Stack

- **OS**: Ubuntu / Arch Linux
- **Editor**: Neovim with minimal config
- **Terminal**: Alacritty or Kitty
- **Shell**: Zsh with minimal prompt
- **Multiplexer**: Tmux

## Why Terminal-First?

There's something powerful about a text-only interface. No notifications popping up. No colorful icons fighting for attention. Just you and your thoughts, flowing through the keyboard.

The terminal forces intentionality. Every command is deliberate. Every action is considered.

## Key Tools

**File Management**: `ranger` or `nnn` for quick navigation
**Search**: `ripgrep` and `fzf` for finding anything instantly
**System Monitoring**: `htop`, `btop` for resource awareness
**Git**: `lazygit` for a pleasant git interface

## The Aesthetic Connection

This approach to computing mirrors the design of this blog - minimal, functional, focused. The N-O-D-E aesthetic isn't just visual; it's a philosophy of stripping away the unnecessary to reveal what matters.

The best tools are invisible. They get out of the way and let you work.
